There is currently relatively minimal stuff here.
do_sock.cc and pgn.h right now allow you to listen
to CAN messages. You need to have the CAN interface
already up on the BBB and a CAN shield.

Other useful files:
overlay/build.sh: Run this file in order to start the CAN interface
test-dump: From a test run of candump with the Airmar 220WX attached
